# Revamped Portfolio Site

This is my latest version of my portfolio site. I decided to revamp my previous version found on http://imamitpatel.com using React, making it easier to update through Reacts' component system. My portfolio site has the following sections below to show off my work.

### Title Page
(Kind of self explanatory)

### Skills
This is my current skill list of what I've learned so far in web development. I will be expanding this section for the indefinite future :)

### Projects
These are my main projects that I would say are my best ones. You can expect me to also expand this section indefinitely, as I plan on building more interesting stuff.
